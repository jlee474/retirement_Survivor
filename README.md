Calculates survivability of an investment portfolio based on historical S&P 500 data or fixed annual rate of return. 
The user sets the type of simulation and parameters (such as initial withdrawal rate), and once the calculate button is clicked, the output is displayed.
Say for instance you want to know whether a $1million dollar portfolio at a 4% initial withdrawal rate will last X number of years based on the S&P market performance. 
This simulation can calculate for all starting years that have S&P market return data. 
This is helpful for illustrating sequential risk, as it shows starting initial withdrawals during a bear market 'era' (despite bull market in later years) is much more likely to exhaust an investment portfolio. 
The user can also simulate a random market return, such that each year provides an annual return based on the actual S&P performance from a random year.
